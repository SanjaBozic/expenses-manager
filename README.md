# Expenses Manager

**Expenses Manager** is a modern, user-friendly web application for tracking personal expenses and income. It provides insightful statistics, interactive charts, and flexible category management, all built with React, Ant Design, and TypeScript. 

## Features

- **Dashboard Overview:**  
  Visualize your financial health with summary statistics, pie charts, and a waterfall chart for income vs. expenses over time.

- **Expense & Income Tracking:**  
  Add, edit, and delete transactions. Each entry supports multiple categories, amounts, dates, and descriptions.

- **Category Management:**  
  Create, edit, and color-code your own expense and income categories.

- **Filtering:**  
  Filter your data by daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly periods for focused analysis.

- **Data Persistence, Privacy & Offline Support:**  
  All your data in Expenses Manager is stored entirely in your browserâ€™s local storage. This means your expenses, income, and categories never leave your deviceâ€”ensuring complete privacy and security, no account required. Because the app does not rely on any external servers or cloud services, you can use Expenses Manager fully offline.  Your data will always be available, even without an internet connection.

- **Responsive UI:**  
  Clean, responsive design using Ant Design components and theming (light/dark mode).

## How It Works

- **Data Context:**  
  All data (expenses, income, categories) is managed via React Context and stored in localStorage for persistence.

- **Grids:**  
  Expenses and income are displayed in editable tables. You can add, edit, or delete rows inline.

- **Charts:**  
  The dashboard uses Ant Design Plots for pie and waterfall charts, providing a visual breakdown of your finances.

- **Filtering:**  
  Use the dashboard filters to view your data by different time periods.

- **Category Colors:**  
  Assign colors to categories for easy identification in tables and charts.

- **Theming:**  
  Switch between light and dark mode using the toggle in the top navigation.

## Customization

- **Add/Edit Categories:**  
  Go to Settings â†’ Categories to manage your categories and their colors.

- **Data Reset:**  
  To clear all data, use your browserâ€™s localStorage tools.
